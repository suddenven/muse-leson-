Koffee Kart began as a whim of Kevin Kariuki's in 1985. After spending years studying the art of coffee cultivation in his native Nairobi, Kenya, Kevin was struck by the limitations of brick-and-mortar cafes and restaurants here in San Francisco. Why not bring the coffee to the people, where the people want it, in the most eco-friendly way possible? Strap an espresso machine on a three-wheeled rickshaw and you're most of the way there. Add the finest original roasts from Africa, Central America and the Pacific and youâ€™ve found the Koffee Kart of San Francisco. 
The Koffee Kart specializes in versatile coffee, full bodied and smooth whether brewed as espresso or drip from multiple origins (and producers). This has been very important to Koffee Kart's  growth and continued success.
