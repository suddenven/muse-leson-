TASTING NOTES
Three Speed Blend is a coffee developed specifically for the Koffee Kart Coffee near Nekempte, Ethiopia in true semi-forest conditions. A farm created from the ground up for special coffee production, forest canopy is unbroken throughout, and coffee is integrated into the natural landscape. Altitudes are an incredible 2000-2200 meters. The two Anyetsu varieties produce very clean berry and floral notes with natural processing, and Geisha-like citrus and floral in washed processing.

TASTING NOTES
A versatile coffee, full bodied and smooth whether brewed as espresso or drip. This coffee brings together multiple origins (and producers) that have been very important to Koffee Kart's growth and continued success.
